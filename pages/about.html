I strive to create quality relationships with each client and provide superior service while exceeding expectations.<br><br></p>

                My goal is simple: To help you help yourself. Whether you suffer from the aches and pains of daily life, an injury incurred from a slip on the ice, the repercussions of a car accident, or overall chronic pain, I can work through the puzzle of soft tissue issues to help you effectively find relief.<br><br>
                
                Not everyone functions the same. Therefore, every massage shouldn’t be the same. I customize each session to fit your individual needs and goals, whether we’re working over the long term or fixing the issue of the day.”<br><br>

                    Growing up in the suburbs of Minneapolis, I was very active in alpine ski racing, volleyball, and dance. All that got halted for a moment when I was in three car accidents when I was 16. I was able to walk out of all of them, assuming I was “fine,” but as time passed, I learned first-hand what whiplash can do to your back, neck, and head (and sometimes, your spirit).<br>
                    I didn’t want to let it slow me down, so I didn’t. It took a few years, but I discovered a combination of massage therapy, chiropractic care, and a routine of Pilates, running, and other exercise helped me manage the symptoms and get back to living life as usual.<br><br>  
                    After graduating from the University of Denver as a young adult, I taught children’s alpine skiing in Keystone, Colorado for four years, and also spent a summer living, working, and playing outside Denali National Park in Alaska. I didn’t let the biggest mountains I could find slow me down, even after a few bumps and bruises during my teen years.<br><br>

                    In 2016, I graduated from CenterPoint Massage and Shiatsu Therapy School and Clinic with a specialization in Western Therapeutic Massage.<br>
                    Today, I specialize in helping you find relief from upper body aches and pains; whether you suffer from chronic conditions, whiplash, tension headaches, old or new injury, or just the stress of daily life, I can help you find relief so you can get back to climbing mountains (or life as usual).<br><br>
                    Outside of work, I like adventuring with my husband, Dan, whether it be out of state, out of country, or through the northwoods of Minnesota with our German Shorthair Pointer/Springer Spaniel mix, Rufus. We love kayaking, paddleboarding, hiking, fishing, camping, skiing (cross-country and downhill), snowshoeing… really anything that gets us out enjoying mother nature.
